The 3 features of this App

• Fetch data from a JSON file <br />
• Add Items to the cart <br />
• Cart Toast is added when the user wants to add a course twice and the user does not have enough Credit to add a course <br />

State Management of the App

useEffect:-
I have added useEffect to fetch the data when the App render for the first time.

useState:-
This one is mostly used state in the app. This one helps to change data, add data to the array. For manipulation of data this state is always handy!
